I'm following the hackpad tutorial, seems kinda ok right now, will probably be more difficult as I go. Probably the most confusing thing for me right now is the OPL stuff and symbols and footprints and the menu things like the XIAO things; I'm just following the guide to lead me through.   

## 10/5/2025 5 PM - Made PCB

The PCB part kicked my butt hard, DRC is so confusinggggg
I finally finished the PCB, still following the tutorial, hoping to get some more progress today.
As a complete beginner to hardware, I feel that my progress is pretty fast, I hope to keep this pace up.

this took so long and im soooo tired lmao, i still dont know how to combine the two so that i can try to see if they match up
there was a lot of trial and error and thats probably good but it kinda sucked lol
just gotta keep going, so close yet so far...  

## 10/21/2025 - Firmware and GitHub  

Firmware is so confusing... even had to take a break away from this project for two weeks...
For the firmware I combined the hackpad code that's on the guide and the code from https://github.com/palmacas/MacroBoard, it was really difficult to try to find what to do because the hackpad tutorial doesn't quite help me with that... I also put all my things on github mostly using https://github.com/palmacas/MacroBoard as an example, and I think I'm mostly done with the planning of this project, hopefully I get approved!
