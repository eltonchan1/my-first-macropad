I'm following the hackpad tutorial, seems kinda ok right now, will probably be more difficult as I go. Probably the most confusing thing for me right now is the OPL stuff and symbols and footprints and the menu things like the XIAO things; I'm just following the guide to lead me through.

The PCB part kicked my butt hard, DRC is so confusinggggg
I finally finished the PCB, still following the tutorial, hoping to get some more progress today.
As a complete beginner to hardware, I feel that my progress is pretty fast, I hope to keep this pace up.
